This JSP code will populate the form fields of your PDF and display it in a client’s browser.  It uses the wonderful iText library that was originally created by Bruno Lowagie.

This is the java code. You can download the zip file or the pdf and jsp file individually. Just put them in your root and run them. After that, modify them as you wish.
